# 🌹 Dipsana's One-Year Journey 🌹

A beautiful, cinematic experience created for our one-year anniversary.

## ✨ Features
- **Floral Theme**: Falling rose petals and a soft romantic aesthetic.
- **Milestone Chapters**: A journey through our most important moments.
- **Interactive Love Quiz**: Fun and cute questions with heart explosion effects.
- **Dynamic Montage**: A cross-faded video and photo showcase of our memories.
- **Romantic Audio**: Custom background music with smooth dimming effects.
- **Cursor Magic**: A soft "stardust" glow that follows your touch.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Since this uses local files, simply open `index.html` in your browser.
2. **Music Note**: Browsers block auto-playing music. **Click anywhere on the screen** once to start the melody.
3. If you are hosting on GitHub Pages, just push the files and it will work perfectly!

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `assets/`: Contains all our personal photos, videos, and music.
- `js/stages/`: The logic for each of the 9 emotional chapters.
- `css/style.css`: The romantic visual design.

**Made with love for Dipsana.**
